Find Me Anything
========

A follow up to the simple "Find Me Starbucks" watchface app (https://github.com/patcat/FindMeStarbucks), this time demonstrating how to use the customisation and local storage capabilities in the the Pebblekit JavaScript Framework. Rather than forcing a user to see where Starbucks is at all times, the user can open up a settings page and choose their own custom place of interest which is stored locally for each time they use the watchface.

If you extend this or make something completely different based off this original code example, please do let me know! I'd love to see where you take the Pebblekit JavaScript Framework and the huge number of APIs on the web! I'm on Twitter at @thatpatrickguy, or you can find me at http://www.patrickcatanzariti.com.

Best of luck,

PatCat
